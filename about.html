<h1> About Yun </h1>           

</header>

<p> Hi there! I’m Yun, a travel lover.  <br>
    Travel makes me a more independent and open-minded person. <br>
    I enjoy experiencing different cultures and have visited more than 20 countries around the world. <br>
    On this web, I focus on sharing photos I took in the state, but if you are interested in my travel experience,  <br>
    please feel free to contact me. I’m looking forward to exchanging fun stories with you! </p>
